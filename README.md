# Robotic_Arm_TX_ESP32

Repo for my ESP32 based hand-controllable robotic arm's GLOVE that is also able to record and play moves itself.

_Please do note that this is a project that I will be dealing with a few hours a week, so this project will take a long time to get from zero (hardware checks) to finish (fully functional robot arm). So bear with me :)_
